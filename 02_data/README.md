## Prerequisites

Before starting these materials, you should have:
- Basic familiarity with either R or Python (covered in 01_intro/)
- Understanding of basic programming concepts
- Interest in statistical analysis and data science

## Key Concepts

### Data Types vs Data Structures
- **Data Types**: The fundamental building blocks (int, float, string, etc.)
- **Data Structures**: Ways to organize and store data (lists, arrays, data frames, etc.)

### Language-Specific Approaches
- **R**: Vectorized operations, statistical focus, factor types
- **Python**: Object-oriented, general-purpose, extensive libraries

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines:
1. **Choose appropriate data types** for your use case
2. **Use meaningful variable names**
3. **Write clean, readable code**
4. **Handle errors appropriately**
5. **Document your code**

### R-Specific:
1. **Use factors for categorical variables**
2. **Leverage vectorized operations**
3. **Check data types before analysis**
4. **Use appropriate data structures**

### Python-Specific:
1. **Use type hints for better documentation**
2. **Choose the right data structure for efficiency**
3. **Follow PEP 8 style guidelines**
4. **Use list comprehensions when appropriate**
