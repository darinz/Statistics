# Measures of Variability

## Overview

Measures of variability describe how spread out or dispersed the data is around the central tendency. They complement measures of central tendency to give us a complete picture of our data distribution. Understanding variability is crucial for statistical inference, quality control, and decision-making.

### Why Variability Matters

- **Data Quality**: High variability may indicate data quality issues or heterogeneity
- **Statistical Inference**: Variability affects confidence intervals and hypothesis tests
- **Process Control**: Low variability often indicates stable, predictable processes
- **Comparison**: Allows comparison of consistency across different groups
- **Risk Assessment**: Variability is directly related to uncertainty and risk
- **Model Selection**: Influences choice of statistical models and methods

### Types of Variability Measures

1. **Range**: Simple measure of spread (max - min)
2. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Robust measure of middle 50% spread
3. **Variance**: Average squared deviation from mean
4. **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance, same units as data
5. **Coefficient of Variation**: Relative measure of variability
6. **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: Average absolute deviation
7. **Percentiles**: Position-based measures of spread

## Range

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It's the simplest measure of variability but is highly sensitive to outliers.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Range Formula**:
```math
\text{Range} = x_{\max} - x_{\min}
```

**Properties of Range**:
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Sensitive to outliers
- Depends only on two values
- Not affected by the distribution shape
- Always non-negative

### Basic Range Calculation

See the function `basic_range_calculation()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to demonstrate basic range calculation with manual verification, outlier effects, and range as percentage of mean.

### Range by Group

See the function `range_by_group()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to calculate and visualize range by group using the mtcars dataset, including range percentages and bar plots.

## Interquartile Range (IQR)

The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1). It's a robust measure that is not affected by outliers.

### Mathematical Foundation

**IQR Formula**:
```math
\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1
```

where $Q_1$ is the 25th percentile and $Q_3$ is the 75th percentile.

**Properties of IQR**:
- Robust to outliers
- Represents the middle 50% of data
- Used in box plots and outlier detection
- Not affected by extreme values
- Good for skewed distributions

### Basic IQR Calculation

See the function `basic_iqr_calculation()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to demonstrate basic IQR calculation with manual verification, quartile understanding, and IQR as percentage of median.

### IQR by Group

See the function `iqr_by_group()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to calculate IQR by group and compare IQR vs Range for the mtcars dataset.

## Variance

Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It's the foundation for many statistical methods.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Population Variance**:
```math
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2
```

**Sample Variance**:
```math
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
```

**Properties of Variance**:
- Always non-negative
- Sensitive to outliers
- Units are squared
- Used in statistical inference
- Minimized by the mean

### Population vs Sample Variance

See the functions `population_variance()`, `sample_variance()`, and `variance_comparison()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to compare population vs sample variance and understand the difference between n and n-1 denominators.

### Variance by Group

See the function `variance_by_group()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to calculate variance by group and visualize using the mtcars dataset.

## Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is the square root of variance and is in the same units as the original data. It's the most commonly used measure of variability.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Population Standard Deviation**:
```math
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
```

**Sample Standard Deviation**:
```math
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
```

**Properties of Standard Deviation**:
- Same units as original data
- Sensitive to outliers
- Used in normal distribution properties
- Basis for confidence intervals
- Used in z-scores and standardization

### Basic Standard Deviation

See the functions `population_sd()` and `basic_standard_deviation()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to demonstrate basic standard deviation calculation with manual verification and the empirical rule.

### Standard Deviation by Group

See the function `standard_deviation_by_group()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to calculate standard deviation by group and visualize mean Â± SD using the mtcars dataset.

## Coefficient of Variation

The coefficient of variation (CV) is the ratio of standard deviation to mean, expressed as a percentage. It allows comparison of variability across different scales.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Coefficient of Variation Formula**:
```math
CV = \frac{s}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%
```

**Properties of CV**:
- Dimensionless measure
- Allows comparison across different scales
- Sensitive to small means
- Used in quality control
- Good for positive data only

See the functions `cv()` and `coefficient_of_variation_examples()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to calculate coefficient of variation and compare variability across different variables with visualizations and interpretation guidelines.

## Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

MAD is the average of the absolute deviations from the mean. It's more robust than standard deviation but less commonly used.

### Mathematical Foundation

**MAD Formula**:
```math
\text{MAD} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - \bar{x}|
```

**Properties of MAD**:
- Same units as original data
- More robust than standard deviation
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Not used in normal distribution properties
- Computationally simple

See the functions `mad_calculation()` and `mad_examples()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to demonstrate MAD calculation and comparison with standard deviation.

## Percentiles and Quantiles

Percentiles divide the data into 100 equal parts, while quantiles divide into any number of parts.

### Mathematical Foundation

**Percentile Definition**:
The $p$th percentile is the value below which $p\%$ of the data falls.

**Common Percentiles**:
- 25th percentile (Q1): First quartile
- 50th percentile: Median
- 75th percentile (Q3): Third quartile
- 90th percentile: 90% of data below this value

See the functions `percentiles_examples()`, `percentile_rank()`, and `percentile_rank_examples()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to demonstrate percentile calculations, five-number summary, and percentile rank calculations.

## Robust Measures of Variability

### Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)

MAD around the median is a robust measure of variability.

See the function `robust_variability_measures()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to demonstrate robust measures of variability including MAD and comparisons with IQR.

### Quartile Coefficient of Dispersion

The quartile coefficient of dispersion is a robust relative measure of variability.

See the functions `qcd()` and `quartile_coefficient_examples()` in [06_measures_variability.py](06_measures_variability.py) for code to calculate quartile coefficient of dispersion and compare with CV.
