# Repeated Measures ANOVA

## Overview

Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a powerful statistical technique used to analyze data where the same subjects are measured multiple times under different conditions. This within-subjects design is more powerful than between-subjects designs because it controls for individual differences and reduces error variance, leading to increased statistical power and more precise effect estimates.

### Key Concepts

**Within-Subjects Design**: A research design where each participant is measured under all experimental conditions, allowing for direct comparison of conditions within the same individuals.

**Individual Differences**: The natural variation between participants that is controlled for in repeated measures designs, reducing error variance.

**Sphericity**: The assumption that the variances of the differences between all pairs of conditions are equal, which is crucial for the validity of repeated measures ANOVA.

**Compound Symmetry**: A stronger assumption than sphericity, requiring equal variances and equal covariances between all conditions.

### Mathematical Foundation

The repeated measures ANOVA model can be expressed as:

```math
Y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \pi_j + \epsilon_{ij}
```

Where:
- $`Y_{ij}`$ is the observed value for the jth subject in the ith condition
- $`\mu`$ is the overall population mean
- $`\alpha_i`$ is the effect of the ith condition (treatment effect)
- $`\pi_j`$ is the effect of the jth subject (individual differences)
- $`\epsilon_{ij}`$ is the random error term

### Sum of Squares Decomposition

The total variability in repeated measures data is partitioned into three components:

```math
SS_{Total} = SS_{Between Subjects} + SS_{Within Subjects}
```

Where:
- $`SS_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{..})^2`$
- $`SS_{Between Subjects} = k\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\bar{Y}_{.j} - \bar{Y}_{..})^2`$ (individual differences)
- $`SS_{Within Subjects} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{.j})^2`$ (within-subject variation)

The within-subjects sum of squares is further partitioned into:

```math
SS_{Within Subjects} = SS_{Conditions} + SS_{Error}
```

Where:
- $`SS_{Conditions} = n\sum_{i=1}^{k}(\bar{Y}_{i.} - \bar{Y}_{..})^2`$ (treatment effect)
- $`SS_{Error} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{i.} - \bar{Y}_{.j} + \bar{Y}_{..})^2`$ (residual error)

### Degrees of Freedom

```math
df_{Total} = nk - 1
df_{Between Subjects} = n - 1
df_{Within Subjects} = n(k - 1)
df_{Conditions} = k - 1
df_{Error} = (n - 1)(k - 1)
```

Where $`n`$ is the number of subjects and $`k`$ is the number of conditions.

### F-Statistic

```math
F = \frac{MS_{Conditions}}{MS_{Error}} = \frac{SS_{Conditions}/df_{Conditions}}{SS_{Error}/df_{Error}}
```

### Effect Size Measures

**Partial Eta-Squared**:
```math
\eta_p^2 = \frac{SS_{Conditions}}{SS_{Conditions} + SS_{Error}}
```

**Eta-Squared**:
```math
\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{Conditions}}{SS_{Total}}
```

**Omega-Squared** (unbiased estimate):
```math
\omega^2 = \frac{SS_{Conditions} - df_{Conditions} \times MS_{Error}}{SS_{Total} + MS_{Error}}
```

### Sphericity Assumption

The sphericity assumption requires that the variance of the differences between any two conditions is constant:

```math
Var(Y_{i} - Y_{j}) = \sigma^2 \text{ for all } i \neq j
```

This can be tested using Mauchly's test of sphericity, which examines the correlation matrix of the conditions.

## Basic Repeated Measures ANOVA

### Manual Calculation

The manual calculation helps understand the underlying mathematics and provides insight into how the statistical software performs the analysis.

**Code Reference**: See `simulate_repeated_measures_data()` and `manual_repeated_anova()` functions in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The manual calculation involves:
1. **Data Simulation**: Generate repeated measures data with individual differences and condition effects
2. **Sum of Squares Calculation**: Compute SS Total, SS Between Subjects, SS Within Subjects, SS Conditions, and SS Error
3. **Degrees of Freedom**: Calculate df for conditions, error, and total
4. **F-statistic**: Compute F = MS Conditions / MS Error
5. **Effect Size**: Calculate partial eta-squared
6. **Sphericity Measures**: Estimate Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt epsilon values

The manual calculation provides the foundation for understanding how repeated measures ANOVA works and validates the results from statistical software.

### Using Python's Built-in Repeated Measures ANOVA

Python's `statsmodels` provides a convenient way to perform repeated measures ANOVA.

**Code Reference**: See `builtin_repeated_anova()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The built-in function uses `AnovaRM` from statsmodels to perform the analysis automatically, providing:
- F-statistic and p-value
- Degrees of freedom for conditions and error
- ANOVA table with all relevant statistics
- Automatic handling of the repeated measures design

This approach is more convenient for routine analyses while providing the same statistical rigor as manual calculations.

## Descriptive Statistics

### Understanding Repeated Measures Descriptive Statistics

In repeated measures designs, we need to understand several types of statistics:

1. **Condition Means**: The average performance across all subjects for each condition
2. **Subject Means**: The average performance across all conditions for each subject
3. **Individual Differences**: The variation between subjects
4. **Within-Subject Variation**: The variation within each subject across conditions

### Mathematical Definitions

**Condition Mean**: $`\bar{Y}_{i.} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}Y_{ij}`$

**Subject Mean**: $`\bar{Y}_{.j} = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k}Y_{ij}`$

**Grand Mean**: $`\bar{Y}_{..} = \frac{1}{nk}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}Y_{ij}`$

**Individual Differences**: $`SS_{Between Subjects} = k\sum_{j=1}^{n}(\bar{Y}_{.j} - \bar{Y}_{..})^2`$

**Within-Subject Variation**: $`SS_{Within Subjects} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}(Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{.j})^2`$

### Condition and Subject Statistics

**Code Reference**: See `calculate_descriptive_statistics()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The descriptive statistics function calculates:
1. **Condition Statistics**: Mean, standard deviation, standard error, and confidence intervals for each condition
2. **Subject Statistics**: Mean, standard deviation, range, and other summary statistics for each subject
3. **Individual Differences**: How each subject's mean performance differs from the grand mean
4. **Condition Differences**: How each condition's mean differs from the grand mean

This comprehensive analysis helps understand both the treatment effects (condition differences) and individual variability (subject differences) in the repeated measures design.

### Understanding Individual Differences

**Code Reference**: See `analyze_individual_differences()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The individual differences analysis provides:
1. **Performance Level Categorization**: Subjects are classified as Low, Average, or High performers based on their deviation from the grand mean
2. **Within-Subject Variability**: Measures how much each subject's performance varies across conditions
3. **Individual Difference Metrics**: Standard deviation and range of individual differences across subjects
4. **Performance Distribution**: Summary of how many subjects fall into each performance category

This analysis is crucial for understanding the extent of individual differences and how they relate to treatment effects in repeated measures designs.

### Visualization

Visualization is crucial for understanding repeated measures data, as it helps identify patterns, individual differences, and potential violations of assumptions.

#### Individual Subject Profiles

The individual subject profiles plot is the most important visualization for repeated measures data as it shows how each subject changes across conditions.

**Code Reference**: See `plot_individual_profiles()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

This visualization shows:
- **Individual Subject Lines**: Each subject's performance trajectory across conditions
- **Group Mean Line**: The average performance across all subjects
- **Confidence Intervals**: Standard error bars around the group mean
- **Pattern Interpretation**: 
  - Parallel lines indicate consistent individual differences
  - Non-parallel lines indicate individual differences in treatment effects
  - Steep slopes indicate strong treatment effects
  - Flat lines indicate no treatment effect

#### Enhanced Distribution Plots

**Code Reference**: See `plot_distribution()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

This function creates two complementary distribution plots:
1. **Box Plot with Individual Points**: Shows the distribution, median, quartiles, and individual data points for each condition
2. **Violin Plot with Box Plot Overlay**: Shows the density distribution and summary statistics for each condition

Both plots include the mean values as red dots, making it easy to compare central tendency across conditions while seeing the full distribution of the data.

#### Individual Differences Visualization

**Code Reference**: See `plot_individual_differences()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

This function creates two bar plots to visualize individual differences:
1. **Individual Differences from Grand Mean**: Shows how each subject's average performance differs from the overall mean, with reference lines at Â±1 standard deviation
2. **Within-Subject Variability**: Shows the standard deviation of each subject's performance across conditions, with a reference line at the mean variability

These plots help identify subjects who are consistently high or low performers and those who show more or less variability across conditions.

#### Correlation Matrix Visualization

**Code Reference**: See `plot_correlation_matrix()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The correlation matrix heatmap shows the correlations between conditions, which is important for:
- **Sphericity Assessment**: High correlations suggest sphericity assumption may be met
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying which conditions are most similar
- **Assumption Checking**: Understanding the covariance structure of the repeated measures

The correlation matrix is a key diagnostic tool for repeated measures ANOVA, as it helps assess whether the sphericity assumption is reasonable.

#### Trend Analysis Visualization

**Code Reference**: See `trend_analysis()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The trend analysis plot shows:
- **Individual Subject Lines**: Each subject's performance trajectory across conditions
- **Group Mean Line**: Average performance across all subjects
- **Confidence Intervals**: Standard error bars around the group mean
- **Trend Line**: Linear regression line showing the overall trend across conditions

This visualization helps identify whether there's a systematic linear trend in the data, which can be tested statistically using polynomial contrasts.

## Effect Size Analysis

Effect sizes are crucial for understanding the practical significance of repeated measures ANOVA results, as they provide information about the magnitude of effects independent of sample size.

### Understanding Effect Size Measures in Repeated Measures

#### Partial Eta-Squared ($`\eta_p^2`$)

Partial eta-squared is the most commonly used effect size measure in repeated measures ANOVA. It represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the condition effect, controlling for individual differences.

```math
\eta_p^2 = \frac{SS_{Conditions}}{SS_{Conditions} + SS_{Error}}
```

**Advantages:**
- Controls for individual differences
- Ranges from 0 to 1
- Easy to interpret
- Most commonly reported in literature

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be biased upward in small samples
- Values can be larger than in between-subjects designs

#### Eta-Squared ($`\eta^2`$)

Eta-squared represents the proportion of total variance explained by the condition effect.

```math
\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{Conditions}}{SS_{Total}}
```

**Advantages:**
- Intuitive interpretation
- Values sum to 1 across all effects

**Disadvantages:**
- Does not control for individual differences
- Can be misleading in repeated measures designs

#### Omega-Squared ($`\omega^2`$)

Omega-squared is an unbiased estimate of the population effect size.

```math
\omega^2 = \frac{SS_{Conditions} - df_{Conditions} \times MS_{Error}}{SS_{Total} + MS_{Error}}
```

**Advantages:**
- Unbiased estimate
- More conservative than eta-squared

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be negative for small effects
- Less commonly reported

### Comprehensive Effect Size Calculation

**Code Reference**: See `calculate_repeated_effect_sizes()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The comprehensive effect size calculation provides multiple measures of effect size:

1. **Partial Î·Â²**: Most commonly used effect size for repeated measures ANOVA, controlling for individual differences
2. **Î·Â²**: Total variance explained by the condition effect
3. **ÏÂ²**: Unbiased estimate of population effect size
4. **Cohen's f**: Effect size for power analysis
5. **Individual Differences Effect Sizes**: How much variance is explained by individual differences
6. **Condition-Specific Effects**: Cohen's d for each condition compared to the grand mean
7. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for partial Î·Â² using resampling

This comprehensive approach provides multiple perspectives on the magnitude and practical significance of the treatment effect.

### Effect Size Interpretation

**Code Reference**: See `interpret_effect_size()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The effect size interpretation function provides:
1. **Multiple Effect Size Measures**: Interpretation guidelines for partial Î·Â², Î·Â², Cohen's f, and Cohen's d
2. **Standardized Categories**: Small, medium, and large effect size classifications
3. **Practical Significance**: Assessment of whether effects are practically meaningful
4. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Clear interpretation of both condition effects and individual differences

This function helps researchers understand not just statistical significance but also the practical importance of their findings.

### Effect Size Visualization

**Code Reference**: See `plot_effect_sizes()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The effect size visualization function creates two complementary plots:
1. **Effect Size Comparison**: Bar plot comparing different effect size measures (partial Î·Â², Î·Â², ÏÂ²) for condition effects and individual differences
2. **Condition-Specific Effects**: Bar plot showing Cohen's d for each condition compared to the grand mean

Both plots include reference lines for effect size interpretation (small, medium, large) to help researchers quickly assess the practical significance of their findings.

## Post Hoc Tests

### Pairwise Comparisons

**Code Reference**: See `post_hoc_pairwise_tests()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The post hoc analysis provides two approaches for pairwise comparisons:

1. **Tukey's HSD Test**: Controls family-wise error rate for all pairwise comparisons
2. **Bonferroni-Corrected Paired t-tests**: More conservative approach that divides alpha by the number of comparisons

The function returns:
- **Estimated Marginal Means**: Mean scores for each condition
- **Tukey Results**: Complete Tukey HSD test results
- **Significant Pairs**: Identification of which condition pairs differ significantly
- **Bonferroni Results**: Paired t-test results with Bonferroni correction

This comprehensive approach ensures that multiple comparisons are handled appropriately while maintaining statistical rigor.

### Trend Analysis

**Code Reference**: See `trend_analysis()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The trend analysis examines whether there are systematic patterns across conditions:

1. **Linear Trend**: Tests whether there's a systematic increase or decrease across conditions
2. **Quadratic Trend**: Tests whether there's a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped pattern
3. **Polynomial Contrasts**: Uses predefined contrast coefficients to test specific trends
4. **F-statistics**: Calculates F-values and p-values for each trend component

This analysis is particularly useful when conditions have a natural order (e.g., time points, dosage levels) and you want to understand the nature of the relationship between conditions and the dependent variable.

## Assumption Checking

Repeated measures ANOVA relies on several key assumptions that must be verified before interpreting results. Violations of these assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions and inflated Type I error rates.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Sphericity**: The variances of the differences between all pairs of conditions are equal
2. **Normality**: Residuals should be normally distributed
3. **Independence**: Observations should be independent (within-subjects correlation is expected)
4. **Linearity**: The relationship between conditions and the dependent variable should be linear

### Comprehensive Sphericity Testing

The sphericity assumption is the most critical assumption for repeated measures ANOVA. It requires that the variance of the differences between any two conditions is constant.

**Code Reference**: See `check_sphericity()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The sphericity testing function provides:
1. **Correlation Matrix Analysis**: Examines correlations between conditions
2. **Variance Ratio Assessment**: Compares variances across conditions
3. **Difference Variance Analysis**: Tests equality of variances of condition differences
4. **Epsilon Calculations**: Greenhouse-Geisser, Huynh-Feldt, and Lower-bound epsilon values
5. **Sphericity Indicators**: Multiple diagnostic criteria for sphericity assessment
6. **Recommendations**: Clear guidance on whether to use corrections or alternatives

This comprehensive approach helps determine whether the sphericity assumption is met and provides appropriate recommendations for analysis.

### Comprehensive Normality Testing

**Code Reference**: See `check_normality_repeated()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The normality testing function provides:
1. **Multiple Normality Tests**: Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Anderson-Darling tests on residuals
2. **Residual Analysis**: Tests normality of residuals (deviations from condition means)
3. **Condition-Specific Testing**: Tests normality within each condition
4. **Diagnostic Plots**: Q-Q plots, histograms with normal curves, and residuals vs fitted plots
5. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Summary of normality test results with clear recommendations
6. **Alternative Suggestions**: Guidance on nonparametric alternatives when normality is violated

This approach ensures that the normality assumption is thoroughly evaluated before proceeding with parametric repeated measures ANOVA.

## Mixed ANOVA

### Between-Subjects and Within-Subjects Factors

**Code Reference**: See `mixed_anova_example()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

Mixed ANOVA designs combine both between-subjects and within-subjects factors:
- **Between-Subjects Factor**: Different groups of participants (e.g., treatment vs. control)
- **Within-Subjects Factor**: Same participants measured across conditions (e.g., time points)
- **Interaction Effects**: Tests whether the effect of the within-subjects factor differs between groups
- **Main Effects**: Tests for overall differences between groups and across time points

This design is particularly useful in clinical trials and intervention studies where you want to compare different treatments over time.

## Nonparametric Alternatives

### Friedman Test

**Code Reference**: See `friedman_test()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The Friedman test is a nonparametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA that:
- Tests for differences between conditions without assuming normality
- Uses rank-based analysis instead of mean-based analysis
- Is robust to violations of normality and sphericity assumptions
- Provides chi-squared statistic and p-value for overall condition differences

This test is particularly useful when the data are ordinal or when the assumptions of parametric repeated measures ANOVA are violated.

### Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for Pairwise Comparisons

**Code Reference**: See `wilcoxon_pairwise_tests()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test provides nonparametric pairwise comparisons that:
- Test for differences between each pair of conditions
- Use rank-based analysis instead of t-tests
- Are robust to violations of normality assumptions
- Can be corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni or other methods
- Provide V-statistic and p-value for each comparison

This approach is particularly useful when the data are not normally distributed or when you want to be conservative about the assumptions.

## Power Analysis

### Power Analysis for Repeated Measures ANOVA

**Code Reference**: See `power_analysis()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

The power analysis function provides:
1. **Current Power**: Calculates the statistical power of the current analysis
2. **Required Sample Size**: Determines the sample size needed for 80% power
3. **Effect Size Integration**: Uses Cohen's f from the effect size analysis
4. **Multiple Conditions**: Handles power analysis for designs with multiple conditions

This analysis helps researchers understand whether their study has adequate power to detect meaningful effects and plan future studies with appropriate sample sizes.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Clinical Trial

**Code Reference**: See `clinical_trial_example()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

This example demonstrates repeated measures ANOVA in a clinical trial context:
- **Data Structure**: 25 patients measured at 4 time points (Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12)
- **Research Question**: Do symptom scores change significantly over time?
- **Analysis**: Repeated measures ANOVA to test for time effects
- **Visualization**: Individual patient trajectories with group means and standard errors

This example shows how repeated measures ANOVA can be used to analyze treatment effectiveness over time in clinical research.

### Example 2: Learning Study

**Code Reference**: See `learning_study_example()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

This example demonstrates repeated measures ANOVA in an educational context:
- **Data Structure**: 30 students measured across 3 learning sessions
- **Research Question**: Does student performance improve across learning sessions?
- **Analysis**: Repeated measures ANOVA to test for session effects
- **Visualization**: Individual student learning curves with group means

This example shows how repeated measures ANOVA can be used to analyze learning progression and educational interventions.

### Example 3: Exercise Study

**Code Reference**: See `exercise_study_example()` function in `16_repeated_measures_anova.py`.

This example demonstrates mixed ANOVA in a sports science context:
- **Data Structure**: 20 participants per exercise type (Aerobic vs. Strength) measured at 3 time points
- **Research Question**: Do different exercise types lead to different fitness improvements over time?
- **Analysis**: Mixed ANOVA to test for exercise type effects, time effects, and their interaction
- **Visualization**: Interaction plot showing fitness scores by exercise type and time

This example shows how mixed ANOVA can be used to analyze the effectiveness of different interventions over time.
