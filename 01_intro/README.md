## Learning Paths

### R Learning Path:
1. **Start Here**: `01_intro_to_r.md` - Basic R concepts
2. **Next Steps**: 
   - Tidyverse packages (dplyr, ggplot2)
   - Statistical modeling (lm, glm)
   - R Markdown for reports
   - Shiny for interactive apps

### Python Learning Path:
1. **Start Here**: `01_intro_to_python.md` - Basic Python concepts
2. **Next Steps**:
   - Pandas for data manipulation
   - NumPy for numerical computing
   - Scikit-learn for machine learning
   - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

## Prerequisites

Before starting either language, you should have:
- Basic computer literacy
- Understanding of high school mathematics
- Familiarity with statistical concepts (helpful but not required)
- No prior programming experience needed

## Getting Started

### For R:
1. Read `01_intro_to_r.md`
2. Install R from [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
3. Install RStudio from [posit.co](https://posit.co/)
4. Follow the examples in the document

### For Python:
1. Read `01_intro_to_python.md`
2. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
