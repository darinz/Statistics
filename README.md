## Overview

Comprehensive statistics curriculum with enhanced modules for both R and Python. Features mathematical foundations (LaTeX), step-by-step code examples, real-world applications, best practices, and hands-on exercises.

**R Track**: Complete statistical analysis from EDA to advanced modeling (logistic regression, time series, multivariate analysis)
**Python Track**: Foundational modules with Pythonic code, pandas/numpy focus

## Learning Objectives

### R Skills
- Statistical analysis and modeling (regression, ANOVA, nonparametric tests)
- Data visualization and exploratory analysis
- Model diagnostics and assumption checking
- Mathematical foundations and effect size reporting

### Python Skills
- Data manipulation with pandas/numpy
- Statistical modeling with scikit-learn/statsmodels
- Visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- Machine learning and reproducible workflows

## Course Structure

### R Track (R/)
**Complete statistical analysis modules:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis, Central Tendency, Variability
